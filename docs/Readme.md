## Installation and run MooPing

### Windows 
Probably I'll add bash script for config and run MooPing but this is a future.

### Linux

## Generating documentation by source code commnets
If you wanna get a documentation you have to run doxygen in main folder.
#### Command to process
- `cd path/to/MooPing`
- `doxygen Doxyfile`

and then you will have docs site in docs_class/index.html file
