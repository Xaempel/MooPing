## Installation and run MooPing

### Windows 
Probably I'll add bash script for config and run MooPing but this is a future.

### Linux
If you wanna automation install and config app run as sudo this command 

`sudo python scripts/project_config_linux.py`

This script in automationing way detect you os and will use your package manager to install required dependencies
### Mac
I'll not support mac never!

## Generating documentation by source code commnets
If you wanna get a documentation you have to run doxygen in main folder.
#### Command to process
- `cd path/to/MooPing`
- `doxygen Doxyfile`

and then you will have docs site in docs_class/index.html file

## Videos how MooPing works
I'll make this videos in future
